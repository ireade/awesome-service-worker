# Awesome Service Worker 📡

> A curated list of useful resources for Service Worker

> Service Workers are the backbone for creating [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) applications. They sit, conceptually, between the network and the document, giving them the ability to intercept the network requests and provide content for documents, even while offline.

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.

## Specification

[W3C Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/) -



> Web Applications traditionally assume that the network is reachable ... HTML documents are loaded over HTTP and traditionally fetch all of their sub-resources via subsequent HTTP requests. **This places web content at a disadvantage versus other technology stacks**.

> The service worker is designed first to redress this balance by providing a Web Worker context, which can be started by a runtime when navigations are about to occur. This event-driven worker is registered against an origin and a path (or pattern), meaning it can be consulted when navigations occur to that location. **Events that correspond to network requests are dispatched to the worker and the responses generated by the worker may over-ride default network stack behavior**. This puts the service worker, conceptually, between the network and a document renderer, **allowing the service worker to provide content for documents, even while offline**.

## The API

### Registering a Service Worker

Assuming the Service Worker file (called `service-worker.js`) is located in the root directory.

```javascript
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register("/service-worker.js")
    .then(function(registration) {
      console.log('Registration succeeded!', registration);
    })
    .catch(function(err) {
      console.log('Registration failed!', err);
    });
}
```

*[See W3C Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/#document-context)*

### The Service Worker Lifecycle

The Service Worker can be in one of the following states.

State | Description
------|-------------
Parsed | The Service Worker is downloaded and aprsed when the user first visits the page
Installing | If the parsed file is new (or a different version of a previous file), installation is attempted
Installed / Waiting | The Service Worker is installed and waiting to be activated
Activating | The Service Worker is in the process of being activated
Activated | The Service Worker is considered the active worker and has control of the document
Redundant | When a new Service Worker has taken control of the page, the previous one is held as redundant

*[See W3C Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/#service-worker-state)*




### Service Worker Events

The Service Worker is event driven. There are four events it can listen for.

Event | Description
------|--------------
`install` | Dispatched when the service worker's installing worker changes
`activate` | Dispatched when the service worker's active worker changes
`fetch` | Dispatched when the document attempts a network (fetch) request
`message` | Dispatched when the service worker receives a message, e.g. from the main document via the postMessage API

*[See W3C Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/#execution-context-events)*
